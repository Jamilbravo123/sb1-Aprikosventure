## Usage Guidelines

1. Image Formats:
   - Use SVG for logos and icons
   - Use WebP/JPEG for photographs (with optimized compression)
   - Use PNG only when transparency is required
   - Provide fallback formats when necessary

2. Naming Convention:
   - Use kebab-case for all file names
   - Be descriptive and consistent
   - Example: `hero-background-light.webp`

3. Optimization:
   - Compress all images before adding
   - Use appropriate resolution for the intended display size
   - Consider providing multiple sizes for responsive images

4. Metadata:
   - Include alt text when using images in components
   - Document any licensing requirements
   - Keep track of image sources

5. Organization:
   - Place images in appropriate category folders
   - Create new categories as needed
   - Maintain a clean directory structure
